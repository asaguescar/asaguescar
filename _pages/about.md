PhD in Physics with +6 years research experience in the field of time-domain astronomy. Experienced in data pipeline creation, statistical modelling, predictive analytics and survey optimization from data-driven decision-making to study kilonovae and gravitationally lensed supernovae and its implications in cosmology. 

I’m currently transitioning into industry and excited to apply my problem-solving and data-driven skills to new challenges. I’m passionate about working on projects that make a real impact—whether it’s in sustainability, social good, or innovative tech. I’m open to different fields and especially interested in areas like environmental sustainability, waste management, and improving quality of life. Looking forward to new opportunities where I can contribute and keep learning!
